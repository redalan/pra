# PRA Dirty
PHP Dirty Framework

PRA aims to be a simple, modular and "dirty" PHP framework. It allows the user to have a router and a fast php manager that allows "dirty" code, so that small projects do not have a complex structure. 

The project structure is currently being redesigned and will be published in this repository opening the possibility of contributors.
